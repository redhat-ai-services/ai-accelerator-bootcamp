# Environment Install and Setup: DEV and PROD Cluster

## parasol-insurance-dev cluster
Follow the following steps to complete the install and setup:

* After the cluster is running and ready, log in as the admin

* Copy the login token as shown in the image. Paste it in the terminal and run it. This should log you into the cluster through the terminal.

If you have certificate errors to login to the cluster, remember to use `--insecure-skip-tls-verify=true` in the login command.

====
* Log into your git account and fork the following repository:
----
https://github.com/redhat-ai-services/ai-accelerator.git
----

* Once forked, clone the repository to your local machine.
[source,terminal]
----
git clone https://github.com/{Git_ID}/ai-accelerator.git
----

* Navigate to the cloned folder with the command:
[source,terminal]

The ai-accelerator project uses Kustomize and GitOps/ArgoCD to deploy our project. It uses the `bootstrap.sh` script to deploy GitOps on the cluster. After GitOps is installed onto the cluster, it will then apply an overlay.

The overlay determines which folder/versions to apply to the cluster. This allows you to reuse components and files across multiple instances with different setups.

In our case, we want to set up a _parasol-insurance-dev_ overlay.

. Open the the redhat-ai-services/ai-accelerator fork that was cloned earlier in your code editor.

. Open `bootstrap/overlays` and create a new folder under the `overlays` folder named `parasol-insurance-dev`.

. In the `bootstrap/overlays/parasol-insurance-dev` folder, create a new file named `kustomization.yaml` add the below to the file.

+
.kustomization.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization

resources:
- ../../base
- ../../../clusters/overlays/parasol-insurance-dev
----

+
[IMPORTANT]
As you can see, the Kustomization resource from above is referencing the `clusters/overlays/parasol-insurance-dev` folder. Let's create that folder

. In the `clusters/overlays/parasol-insurance-dev` folder, create a new file named `kustomization.yaml` add the below content to the file:

+
.kustomization.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization

namespace: openshift-gitops

resources:
  - ../../base
  - ../../../components/argocd/apps/overlays/parasol-insurance-dev

patches:
  # set the repo and branch for applications
  - path: patch-application-repo-revision.yaml
    target:
      group: argoproj.io
      kind: Application

replacements:
  - source:
      kind: Application
      fieldPath: spec.source.repoURL
    targets:
      - select:
          kind: ApplicationSet
        fieldPaths:
          - spec.template.spec.source.repoURL
      - select:
          kind: ApplicationSet
          name: tenants
        fieldPaths:
          - spec.generators.*.git.repoURL
  - source:

      fieldPath: spec.source.targetRevision
    targets:
      - select:
          kind: ApplicationSet
        fieldPaths:
          - spec.template.spec.source.targetRevision
      - select:
          kind: ApplicationSet
          name: tenants
        fieldPaths:
          - spec.generators.*.git.revision
----

. In the `clusters/overlays/parasol-insurance-dev` folder, create a new file named `patchpatch-applicationset-manual-sync.yaml` add the below content to the file:

+
.patchpatch-applicationset-manual-sync.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
- op: remove
  path: /spec/template/spec/syncPolicy
----

. In the `clusters/overlays/parasol-insurance-dev`, create a new file named `patch-application-manual-sync.yaml` add the below content to the file:

+
.patch-application-manual-sync.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
- op: remove
  path: /spec/syncPolicy
----

. In the `clusters/overlays/parasol-insurance-dev` folder, create a new file named `patch-application-repo-revision.yaml` add the below content to the file.
Replace the repoURL with your fork URL.

+
.patch-application-repo-revision.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
- op: replace
  path: /spec/source/repoURL
  value: 'https://github.com/JeetRH/ai-accelerator.git'
- op: replace
  path: /spec/source/targetRevision
  value: main
----

. The folder structure should look like this:

+
image::images/GitOpsFolderStructure1.png[width=20%]

. In the `tenants` folder, create a new folder named `dev`.
Here is where we'll be adding our new resources.

+
NOTE: Remember to add the base and overlays files and folders. Make sure you have the `parasol-insurance-dev` overlay in the `overlays` folder for Argo to pick up what it needs for the DEV environment.


. Run the bootstrap script by running the bootstrap.sh script
[source,terminal]
----
./bootstrap.sh
----

* This will first install the GitOps Operator and then provide the user with the following overlays:

+
.Please enter a number to select a bootstrap folder:
[order=arabic]
1. bootstrap/overlays/parasol-insurance-dev/
2. bootstrap/overlays/rhoai-eus-2.8-aws-gpu/
3. bootstrap/overlays/rhoai-eus-2.8/
4. bootstrap/overlays/rhoai-fast-aws-gpu/
5. bootstrap/overlays/rhoai-fast/

* For _**DEV**_ environments type the number 1 and press Enter.

## parasol-insurance-prod cluster
The steps to set up the _**parasol-insurance-prod**_ cluster are the same as _parasol_insurance_dev_, except change _dev_ to _prod_ in the kustomization files and folders.

When running the bootstrap script, select `bootstrap/overlays/parasol-insurance-prod`
